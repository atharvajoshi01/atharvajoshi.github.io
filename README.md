### WORK EXPERIENCE
R&D Intern @ Rucha Yantra LLP
•Contributed to live industrial projects for clients such as Skoda Auto Volks Wagon, Pune and
INOX,Gujrat.
•Engineered an Automated Welding Machine(Special Purpose Machine) at INOX, enhancing
precision to 98% from a 1mm error, replacing manual welding, and streamlining operations.
Contributed to optimizing Traffic Management at SAVW, achieving a ~97% success rate in
sustaining vehicle flow.
•Leveraged skills in Python, Jetson Nano, and YOLO v8 to develop solutions, annotate images, and
refine algorithms for traffic management.
•Led the implementation of tech-driven precision enhancements in welding, resulting in a 40%
reduction in defects and a 25% increase in production efficiency, saving over 100 work hours per
month

### PROJECTS
#### Landmark Classification & Tagging for Social Media
##### CNN
