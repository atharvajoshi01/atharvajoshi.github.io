### WORK EXPERIENCE
#### R&D Intern @ Rucha Yantra LLP

•Contributed to live industrial projects for clients such as Skoda Auto Volks Wagon, Pune and
INOX,Gujrat.

•Engineered an Automated Welding Machine(Special Purpose Machine) at INOX, enhancing
precision to 98% from a 1mm error, replacing manual welding, and streamlining operations.
Contributed to optimizing Traffic Management at SAVW, achieving a ~97% success rate in
sustaining vehicle flow.

•Leveraged skills in Python, Jetson Nano, and YOLO v8 to develop solutions, annotate images, and
refine algorithms for traffic management.

•Led the implementation of tech-driven precision enhancements in welding, resulting in a 40%
reduction in defects and a 25% increase in production efficiency, saving over 100 work hours per
month

### PROJECTS
#### Landmark Classification & Tagging for Social Media
##### CNN

•Addressed accuracy and efficiency enhancement for a landmark classification system to refine content organization and search.

•Applied transfer learning and hyperparameter fine-tuning to optimize the existing CNN architecture.

•Achieved a substantial 20% overall accuracy improvement, including a 10% boost in CNN accuracy (from 50% to over 60%).

•Fine-tuning efforts yielded a remarkable 22% increase in test accuracy (reaching 72%) with reduced test loss to 1.01.

•Streamlined content organization and search capabilities, resulting in a notable 40% improvement in landmark classification

accuracy.Implemented advanced machine learning algorithms and data-driven optimizations to achieve these results.

#### LSTM Chatbot
##### RNN

•Enhanced a Seq2Seq LSTM-based chatbot's efficiency and responsiveness.

•Developed a model with 0.689 train loss in 200 epochs and diminished vocabulary by 83% to 5,458 words.

•Adjusted hyperparameters for 20% faster convergence and 15% reduced training time.

•Improved chatbot response by 10% through robust pre-processing,reducing data handling time by 25%.

•Achieved perfect model accuracy by 17% and enhanced conversation coherence by 12% using adaptable learning rates and
attention mechanisms,resulting in more engaging AI experiences.
